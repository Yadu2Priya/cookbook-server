      "1. To make pasta alla puttanesca, first rinse the capers under running water to remove the excess salt, then dry them and chop them coarsely with a knife.

In a large pan, pour the oil, the whole peeled garlic cloves, the chopped dried chilli and the anchovies.\n\n3. Also add the desalted capers. Brown over medium heat for 5 minutes, stirring often, so the anchovies will melt and all the aromas will be released. At this point, add the lightly crushed peeled tomatoes, mix with a spoon and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat. Meanwhile, cook the spaghetti al dente.\n\n4. When the sauce is ready, remove the garlic cloves and add the crushed olives. Flavor the sauce with the chopped fresh parsley.\n\n5. When the pasta is al dente, drain it directly into the pan and sauté it for half a minute, just long enough for all the flavors to blend. Spaghetti alla puttanesca are ready to be served piping hot",

Heat oil in a deep pan over medium flame. Check whether oil is sufficiently hot or not by dropping a pinch of mixture in hot oil if it comes upward immediately, then oil is sufficiently hot for deep frying. Take small portion of mixture in the hand and gently drop 3-4 small fritters into the oil and deep-fry until they turn golden brown in color keep stirring occasionally in between so that they cook evenly and keep heat/flame to medium.\n\n5. Take them out using slotted spoon and drain excess oil. Place them on paper towel in a plate to absorb excess oil. Repeat the process for remaining batter and deep-fry in batches. Do not over crowd the oil with onion fritters, this will help them cook evenly.\n\n6.

This whole combo can also be served with the Indian chai.",

    ingredients: [
      "Spaghetti, mezze maniche or rigatoni 350g,  Guanciale or rindless bacon 115g,  grated Pecorino Romano (or Parmigiano Reggiano) 30g,  Fresh large egg yolks 4,  Black Pepper, Salt. ",

    cookingTime: 20,
    method:
      "1. Cut the guanciale into ¼″ layers, then into long, 2″ strips.\n\n2. Combine the egg yolks with the grated cheese and a pinch of black pepper.\n\n3. Brown the strips of guanciale for 2 minutes in a pan, until crisp, then turn off the heat and leave to cool.\n\n4. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt. Cook the pasta, setting aside a ladleful of the pasta cooking water, until al dente. Drain.\n\n5. Pour the reserved hot water into the frying pan with the cooled guanciale, then transfer the pasta to the same pan and mix together. Add the yolk and cheese mixture, stirring rapidly.\n\n6. In the warm pan with the hot pasta, the eggs will cook gently and become creamy - don't stir over heat otherwise the carbonara will become lumpy. It's important to stir quickly to prevent the yolks from congealing and taking on the texture of scrambled eggs.\n\n7. Season with freshly milled black pepper and serve immediately on heated plates.",

The thing is, homemade hummus is so inexpensive and easy to make that the store-bought hummus won’t taste the same after you try this version. Hummus is a traditional Mediterranean diet recipe and is made with extra virgin olive oil, not canola oil, while most store-bought hummus contains canola oil. Your homemade hummus will already taste better and be healthier with extra virgin olive oil.\n\nThis hummus has some garlic, but isn’t too garlicky. I also really love the tahini ratio in this recipe because I find that some hummus has too much tahini which makes for a strong after taste. The thing that makes hummus so easy to make is that you basically just add all of the ingredients to a food processor and blend it.\n\nI like to use this hummus in a few different ways. I love to dip pita bread in it for a quick snack. I will serve it as an appetizer at lunch or dinner, as it goes well with most other Mediterranean diet recipes. However, my favorite thing is to make a falafel pita wrap with tons of hummus spread inside. Here is one of my favorite falafel recipes.\n\nIf you’re bringing this hummus to a guests house, impress them by garnishing with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, a dusting of paprika, and a sprinkle of pine nuts. They will be impressed with the presentation as well as the amazing Mediterranean flavors of this traditional Lebanese hummus.",
